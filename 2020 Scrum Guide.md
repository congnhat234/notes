# The Scrum Guide
## Scrum Definition
- Scrum is a lightweight framework helps generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
- Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat
- The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it.

## Scrum Theory
- Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
- Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.
- Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.
- Scrum pillars:  transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### Transparency
- The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
- Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

### Inspection
- The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently todetect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
- Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

### Adaptation
- The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
- Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

## Scrum Values
Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

> Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage

- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Primary focus: the work of the Sprint
- Open about the work and the challenges.
- Scrum Team members respect each other.
- The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing.

👉 These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.

👉 The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.

## Scrum Team
- Scrum Team: a small team of people, consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers, no sub-teams or hierarchies. Focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
- Scrum Teams are cross-functional, self-managing
- The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, **typically 10 or fewer people**.
- If Scrum Teams become too large => should reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams,  share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.
- The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.
- Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.
- Accountabilities: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.

### Developers
👉 Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
- Accountable for:
  - Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
  - Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
  - Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal
  - Holding each other accountable as professionals

### Product Owner
👉 The Product Owner is one person, not a committee, accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

- Accountable for:
  - Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
  - Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items
  - Ordering Product Backlog items
  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood

- The Product Owner may do or may delegate to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.
- The entire organization must respect PO's decisions. These decisions are visible in the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

### Scrum Master
👉 The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide, for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.

👉 Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

- The Scrum Master <span style="color:red;">**serves the Scrum Team**</span> in several ways, including:
  - <span style="color:red;">**Coaching the team**</span> members in self-management and cross-functionality;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments**</span> that meet the Definition of Done;
  - Causing the <span style="color:red;">**removal of impediments**</span> to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Ensuring that all Scrum events take place**</span> and are <span style="color:red;">**positive**</span>, <span style="color:red;">**productive**</span>, and kept within the <span style="color:red;">**timebox**</span>.
- The Scrum Master <span style="color:red;">**serves the Product Owner**</span> in several ways, including:
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping find techniques**</span> for effective <span style="color:red;">**Product Goal**</span> definition and <span style="color:red;">**Product Backlog**</span> management;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping the Scrum Team understand**</span> the need for <span style="color:red;">**clear and concise Product Backlog items**</span>;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping establish**</span> empirical <span style="color:red;">**product planning**</span> for a complex environment; and,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Facilitating stakeholder collaboration**</span> as requested or needed.
- The Scrum Master <span style="color:red;">**serves the organization**</span> in several ways, including:
  - <span style="color:red;">**Leading, training, and coaching**</span> the organization in its Scrum adoption;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Planning and advising Scrum implementations**</span> within the organization;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping employees and stakeholders understand**</span> and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Removing barriers**</span> between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

## Scrum Events
- Event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
- All events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

### The Sprint
- Fixed length events of one month or less
- Starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
- During the Sprint:
  -  No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
  -  Quality does not decrease;
  -  The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
  -  Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
-  When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.
-  Each Sprint may be considered a short project.
- Practices to forecast progress: burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows

💥A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

### Sprint Planning
👉 Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint.

👉 The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.

👉 The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

Sprint Planning topics:
- Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?
  - PO proposes how the product could increase its value
  - Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal
- Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?
  - The Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
  - The more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.
- Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?
  - The Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.
  - Decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less.
  - The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

👉 Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

### Daily Scrum
👉 Purpose: to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
- The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team, held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
- If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.
- Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.
- The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan.

### Sprint Review
👉 Purpose: to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.
- The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
- Review what was accomplished, what has changed in their environment, collaborate on what to do next, the Product Backlog may also be adjusted
- The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.
- The Sprint Review is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

### Sprint Retrospective
👉 Purpose: to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

- The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
-  The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.
- The most impactful improvements may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
- The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a onemonth Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

## Scrum Artifacts
👉 Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value.

Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

### Product Backlog
👉 The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.

- Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event.
- Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.
- The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

#### Commitment: Product Goal
👉 The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.
> A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

👉 The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.

### Sprint Backlog
👉 The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

- The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.
- The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned.
- It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal
👉 The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint.

- It provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.
- It also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.
- The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.

### Increment
👉 An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.
- In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
- Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint.
- An Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.
- Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

#### Commitment: Definition of Done
👉 The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
- The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.
- If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
- If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.

## End Note
👉 The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable.

👉 While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.

# Escaping the Predictability Trap
## Demanding predictability creates a set of predictable dysfunctions
- **Predictable plans** - Comparing actuals to plans is deeply ingrained in many organizations who somehow think that the future can be predicted with accuracy, so any deviation from a plan is evidence of poor performance, and questioning a plan is viewed as “being negative”. Unfortunately, we live in an uncertain world. False certainty does us no good; it actually prevents us from making good choices and from achieving greater goals.  And punishing people because they didn’t guess correctly is a waste of time and discourages important learning.  Instead of demanding predictable plans, focus on articulating clear goals and clearly framing experiments, including how you will evaluate them, and be open to learning new things.
- **Predictable productivity** - Managers love focusing on productivity and “efficiency” but frequently fail to consider the value that is being delivered. Delivering value is what is important, not how many “units of work” (like story points, which are themselves just guesses) were delivered. What is better: driving 100 miles per hour in the wrong direction, or one mile per hour in the right? Productivity is important, but tracking does not help to improve it. Instead, focus your efforts on removing waste and impediments, and clearly articulating goals. When walking a rough and uncertain path, it’s not how fast you go that matters but whether you reach your destination. To go faster, place smaller bets, run shorter experiments, and evaluate where you are more frequently; you’ll save time not having to backtrack later.
- **Predictable careers** - Each of us likes to believe that we are on the path to success. The notion of a “career” is a story we tell ourselves about how what we are doing now is leading to something better. The problem is that we are not very good at anticipating the future, and we really have no idea of the kinds of opportunities we may encounter along the way. It may seem a bit scary that we really don’t know where we are headed, and that luck plays a large part in what we end up doing. The reality is that we cannot really imagine what jobs will exist in ten years, or even five, nor can we conceive that many of today’s jobs will no longer exist. So how to do we prepare ourselves for what lies ahead? By cultivating flexibility, by trying new things, and by solving hard problems and acquiring whatever skills we need to do so. In the end, adaptability and ability to learn quickly are the keys to success, not steadily marching to the beat of someone else’s drum. Just as with Scrum, we succeed personally by trying new approaches and evaluating the results, in measured experiments.
- **Predictable agile transformation** - “Transformation” is a word that I often associate with the phrase “magical thinking”: organizations seem to believe that they can predictively plan how they are going to “become agile”.  This is usually based on the misconception that agile is a process, or is rather like a tool, that can be “installed” or “rolled out” to an organization. It doesn’t work that way. Agility, or the word I think better captures the essence of what we seek, adaptability, is a cultural quality, a way of thinking and acting that deeply changes the way that people see and act in the world. It is not a specific set of practices or behaviors that can be adopted. It is a way of thinking and acting that involves continually seeking better results and better outcomes. As such, specific practices will change as conditions and skills change. We cannot plan how this is going to proceed, and as different teams have different challenges, their path toward agility will be different. There is no “magical” set of practices, roles, or processes that makes this easier.
