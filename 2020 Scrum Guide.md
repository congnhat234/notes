# The Scrum Guide
## Scrum Definition
- Scrum is a lightweight framework helps generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
- Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat
- The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it.

## Scrum Theory
- Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
- Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.
- Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.
- Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### Transparency
- The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
- Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

### Inspection
- The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently todetect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
- Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

### Adaptation
- The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
- Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

## Scrum Values
Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

> Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage

- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Primary focus: the work of the Sprint
- Open about the work and the challenges.
- Scrum Team members respect each other.
- The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing.

👉 These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.

👉 The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.

## Scrum Team
- Scrum Team: a small team of people, consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers, no sub-teams or hierarchies. Focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
- Scrum Teams are cross-functional, self-managing
- The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, **typically 10 or fewer people**.
- If Scrum Teams become too large => should reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams,  share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.
- The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.
- Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.
- Accountabilities: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.

### Developers
👉 Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
- Accountable for:
  - Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
  - Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
  - Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal
  - Holding each other accountable as professionals

### Product Owner
👉 The Product Owner is one person, not a committee, accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

- Accountable for:
  - Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
  - Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items
  - Ordering Product Backlog items
  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood

- The Product Owner may do or may delegate to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.
- The entire organization must respect PO's decisions. These decisions are visible in the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

### Scrum Master
👉 The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide, for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.

👉 Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

- The Scrum Master <span style="color:red;">**serves the Scrum Team**</span> in several ways, including:
  - <span style="color:red;">**Coaching the team**</span> members in self-management and cross-functionality;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments**</span> that meet the Definition of Done;
  - Causing the <span style="color:red;">**removal of impediments**</span> to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Ensuring that all Scrum events take place**</span> and are <span style="color:red;">**positive**</span>, <span style="color:red;">**productive**</span>, and kept within the <span style="color:red;">**timebox**</span>.
- The Scrum Master <span style="color:red;">**serves the Product Owner**</span> in several ways, including:
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping find techniques**</span> for effective <span style="color:red;">**Product Goal**</span> definition and <span style="color:red;">**Product Backlog**</span> management;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping the Scrum Team understand**</span> the need for <span style="color:red;">**clear and concise Product Backlog items**</span>;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping establish**</span> empirical <span style="color:red;">**product planning**</span> for a complex environment; and,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Facilitating stakeholder collaboration**</span> as requested or needed.
- The Scrum Master <span style="color:red;">**serves the organization**</span> in several ways, including:
  - <span style="color:red;">**Leading, training, and coaching**</span> the organization in its Scrum adoption;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Planning and advising Scrum implementations**</span> within the organization;
  - <span style="color:red;">**Helping employees and stakeholders understand**</span> and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Removing barriers**</span> between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

## Scrum Events
- Event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
- All events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

### The Sprint
- Fixed length events of one month or less
- Starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
- During the Sprint:
  -  No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
  -  Quality does not decrease;
  -  The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
  -  Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
- When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.
- Each Sprint may be considered a short project.
- Practices to forecast progress: burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows

💥A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

### Sprint Planning
👉 Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint.

👉 The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.

👉 The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

Sprint Planning topics:
- Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?
  - PO proposes how the product could increase its value
  - Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal
- Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?
  - The Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
  - The more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.
- Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?
  - The Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.
  - Decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less.
  - The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

👉 Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

### Daily Scrum
👉 Purpose: to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
- The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team, held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
- If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.
- Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.
- The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan.

### Sprint Review
👉 Purpose: to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.
- The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
- Review what was accomplished, what has changed in their environment, collaborate on what to do next, the Product Backlog may also be adjusted
- The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.
- The Sprint Review is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

### Sprint Retrospective
👉 Purpose: to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

- The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
- The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.
- The most impactful improvements may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
- The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a onemonth Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

## Scrum Artifacts
👉 Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value.

Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

### Product Backlog
👉 The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.

- Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event.
- Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.
- The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

#### Commitment: Product Goal
👉 The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.
> A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

👉 The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.

### Sprint Backlog
👉 The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

- The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.
- The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned.
- It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal
👉 The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint.

- It provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.
- It also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.
- The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.

### Increment
👉 An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.
- In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
- Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint.
- An Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.
- Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

#### Commitment: Definition of Done
👉 The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
- The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.
- If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
- If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.

## End Note
👉 The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable.

👉 While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.

# Escaping the Predictability Trap
## Demanding predictability creates a set of predictable dysfunctions
- **Predictable plans** - Comparing actuals to plans is deeply ingrained in many organizations who somehow think that the future can be predicted with accuracy, so any deviation from a plan is evidence of poor performance, and questioning a plan is viewed as "being negative". Unfortunately, we live in an uncertain world. False certainty does us no good; it actually prevents us from making good choices and from achieving greater goals. And punishing people because they didn’t guess correctly is a waste of time and discourages important learning. Instead of demanding predictable plans, focus on articulating clear goals and clearly framing experiments, including how you will evaluate them, and be open to learning new things.
- **Predictable productivity** - Managers love focusing on productivity and "efficiency" but frequently fail to consider the value that is being delivered. Delivering value is what is important, not how many "units of work" (like story points, which are themselves just guesses) were delivered. What is better: driving 100 miles per hour in the wrong direction, or one mile per hour in the right? Productivity is important, but tracking does not help to improve it. Instead, focus your efforts on removing waste and impediments, and clearly articulating goals. When walking a rough and uncertain path, it’s not how fast you go that matters but whether you reach your destination. To go faster, place smaller bets, run shorter experiments, and evaluate where you are more frequently; you’ll save time not having to backtrack later.
- **Predictable careers** - Each of us likes to believe that we are on the path to success. The notion of a "career" is a story we tell ourselves about how what we are doing now is leading to something better. The problem is that we are not very good at anticipating the future, and we really have no idea of the kinds of opportunities we may encounter along the way. It may seem a bit scary that we really don’t know where we are headed, and that luck plays a large part in what we end up doing. The reality is that we cannot really imagine what jobs will exist in ten years, or even five, nor can we conceive that many of today’s jobs will no longer exist. So how to do we prepare ourselves for what lies ahead? By cultivating flexibility, by trying new things, and by solving hard problems and acquiring whatever skills we need to do so. In the end, adaptability and ability to learn quickly are the keys to success, not steadily marching to the beat of someone else’s drum. Just as with Scrum, we succeed personally by trying new approaches and evaluating the results, in measured experiments.
- **Predictable agile transformation** - "Transformation" is a word that I often associate with the phrase "magical thinking": organizations seem to believe that they can predictively plan how they are going to "become agile". This is usually based on the misconception that agile is a process, or is rather like a tool, that can be "installed" or "rolled out" to an organization. It doesn’t work that way. Agility, or the word I think better captures the essence of what we seek, adaptability, is a cultural quality, a way of thinking and acting that deeply changes the way that people see and act in the world. It is not a specific set of practices or behaviors that can be adopted. It is a way of thinking and acting that involves continually seeking better results and better outcomes. As such, specific practices will change as conditions and skills change. We cannot plan how this is going to proceed, and as different teams have different challenges, their path toward agility will be different. There is no "magical" set of practices, roles, or processes that makes this easier.

# How to Build Trust to Enable Agility
## What is Trust
> Trust is a willingness to be vulnerable.

When I trust, I am essentially making something important to me vulnerable to the actions of someone else.

Distrust is when I don't feel that something I have made vulnerable to you is actually safe with you.

## Anatomy of Trust
Brené says that when we trust, "we are BRAVING connection with someone."

### Boundaries
> I establish clear boundaries, and I stick to my boundaries. You establish boundaries, and you hold your boundaries. We both respect each other’s boundaries.

The Scrum framework is an example of boundaries that help a Scrum Team focus and self-organize around a goal to deliver shippable product by the end of a Sprint. Team members stick to this boundary by not accepting additional work during the Sprint that would endanger that goal. Others in the organization respect this boundary by not forcing or pressuring them to break this boundary.

People may also set individual boundaries in the context of the workplace. I may set a boundary that I leave my work at the office. Or perhaps I don’t check email on the weekend. Maybe I don’t take on any new projects or activities unless I remove something equivalent.

### Reliability
> I do what I say I will do. You do what you say you will do. Over and over and over again.

There are two things you must consider in order to be reliable.

1. Establish clear expectations.
2. Don’t overcommit.

### Accountability
> I hold you to account for doing the things you said you would do. You can hold me to account for doing the things I said I would do.

And since we are human beings, we are going to screw up.

When you do, own it. Apologize and make amends.

When you are on the receiving end of it, you allow the other person to own it, apologize, and make amends.

### Vault
> What you share with me, I will hold in confidence.  And I expect you to do the same with me.. and with others.

As a Scrum Master, a team member may come to me about issues with another team member. Ultimately, I will coach this team member on addressing the issues with that person directly.

If you put yourself in the other person’s shoes, how would you feel if a team member was complaining about you to someone else?

The Sprint Retrospective is an example of where we honor the 'vault" as a team. Only Scrum Team members participate, and the specifics of what happens in the room stays in the room. A Scrum Master helps keep a positive, continuous improvement focus rather than just dwelling on the negative and complaining.

### Integrity
> This is about choosing courage over comfort. This is about choosing what is right over what is simply fun, fast, or easy. Practice your values rather than just professing them.

Product Owners show integrity by saying no to stakeholders who want something that is not in alignment with the product vision or is of low value. They don't just put it at the bottom of the Product Backlog to make the stakeholder happy.

Scrum Teams show integrity by not showing partially done software in the Sprint Review.

When our leaders profess their values, we expect their actions and decisions to reflect them. People don’t trust leaders who say one thing but then do another. If a leader says he values learning and innovation, but he measures individuals on a strict "billable hours" policy or by "lines of code", this inconsistency breaks down integrity.

### Non-Judgment
> You can be struggling and ask for help, and I will not judge you.  I can be struggling and ask for help, and you will not judge me.

I may think that the quality of your work has been suffering and does not meet our standards, but I am not going to assume you intentionally did poor quality work or that you don’t have the same level of commitment as I do. I can hold you accountable from a place of non-judgment.

Truly believing that we learn from failure is another way that teams and organizations practice non-judgement.

### Generosity
> You can assume the most generous things about my words, actions, and intentions.  And I will do the same for you.

Generosity means recognizing that we are all human. We make mistakes. We go through difficult times. Generosity means we are willing to forgive, offer an opportunity to make amends, and hold space for the inevitable learning and growth that is part of being human and being part of a team.

I may feel disrespected by something you said in our planning session, but I know you would not intentionally hurt me. I will have a direct and honest conversation about how I feel, but I will not label you as a disrespectful person.

# 5 Powerful Things About the Sprint
The Scrum Guide calls the Sprint the “heart of Scrum.”
## #1 - Focus
The purpose of a Sprint is to create a potentially releasable product Increment of value to the organization.

What value is to be delivered is guided by the Sprint Goal, which does not change during the Sprint.

By having this single purpose every Sprint – to create a releasable Increment – the team can bring their focus back to this.  They can set aside the distractions not related to this purpose.  They can take the new information they have uncovered and adapt their plan without losing focus.

## #2 – Predictability
While a Scrum Team may not be able to guarantee the specific scope of the Increment (i.e features/ functions), a team that is using Scrum well will be predictable in delivering a “Done” Increment every Sprint.

Sprints have a consistent cadence.  This consistent cadence helps a Scrum Team understand what they are capable of delivering in a period of time.

A Scrum Team can change the length of a Sprint, but they don’t change it constantly.  They do so intentionally as a part of their commitment to continuous improvement in meeting the business needs.  Then they learn and settle into a new cadence.

## #3 – Control

A question I am often asked is,

> How long should our Sprint be?

My answer is always,

> How frequently does your business need to change direction?

The real driver of the length of a Sprint is how often the business needs to inspect the Increment and adapt the direction based on new information.

In addition, the Sprint time-box gives the business more transparency to and control of cost and schedule.  An organization can fund a number of Sprints and see the value they are getting every Sprint.  This helps make informed decisions about whether or not to keep investing money and on what to invest it.  Ultimately, this is how you control risk in complex environments.

## #4 – Freedom
The Scrum Team has the focus of a Sprint Goal and a time-box.  These boundaries create the freedom for effective self-organization, collaboration, and experimentation.

Teams have to learn by doing, inspecting and adapting along the way.

Sometimes there will be failure.  In fact, failure is a part of learning.  The question is how big of an impact that failure will have. A Sprint limits the impact of failure to the time-box of the Sprint.

## #5 – Opportunity

Scrum is a framework for opportunistic discovery.  To quote Ken Schwaber, it helps us “harness change for competitive advantage.”  Ultimately, successful Sprints enable the benefits of business agility.

Scrum is the art of the possible.  It’s about being open to and ready for the opportunities you discover throughout the journey.
